## AGENT ROSTER
| Codename | Role | Owns |
|----------|------|------|
| Mason | Builder | All code |
| Prism | Creative/Design | UI/UX |
| Blaze | Marketing | Content/campaigns |
| Ace | Sales | Conversion/closing |
| Piper | Email | GHL sequences |
| Rally | Skool/Community | Aurigen Collective |
| Lex | Legal | Compliance/copy review |

| Phantom | Deep security | Threat intelligence |
| Wraith | Absolute security | Complete threat universe |
| Nova | Paid flow QA | Clicks every button in paid view |
| Ghost | Free flow QA | Finds every paywall bypass |

## STANDING RULES (all agents must follow)
- Never reference [seminar brand] in any output
- No fabricated testimonials ever
- Lex must review all user-facing claims before ship
- Knox must pass every PR before merge
- Cipher-Security runs after every major build
- HANDOFF.md must be updated after every session
- CLAUDE.md SESSION MEMORY updated after every session

## OPEN CRITICAL ITEMS
1. states-en.js still publicly accessible (C2)
2. localStorage paid bypass still possible (C3)
3. Language toggle bypass not fully closed
4. Stats 0,0,0 on iPad still intermittent
5. First Deal page navigation incomplete

## CURRENT PR STATUS
All waves 1-4 merged to main.
Next PR: VS view objection handler + testimonial carousel (pending real customers)

## CURRENT SESSION STATUS
- Agent depth rebuilds Section 1 (batch 1+2): COMPLETE — 8 agents rebuilt (Cipher, Knox, Recon, Wraith, Ace, Compass, Scout, Rally, Atlas + existing)
- Agent depth rebuilds Section 2: COMPLETE — Rally, Scout, Compass, Atlas rebuilt with full-depth frameworks
- All 16+ agents now have PERSISTENT MEMORY blocks and depth intelligence

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. C2 fix — serverless data gating
2. C3 fix — server-side session validation
3. VS view objection handler
4. Statute citation teasers on locked states

# AURIGEN COUNTY RESOURCE DIRECTORY — PROJECT MASTER

## What This Project Is
A bilingual (EN/ES) tax lien and tax deed investor directory covering all 50 U.S. states + DC.
Sold as a freemium web app — 7 free states, full access behind a Stripe paywall.
Built for seminar audiences and self-directed real estate investors.

## File Structure
```
/
├── index.html          — Master app (2880+ lines). Single file. All UI, logic, map, gate.
├── states-en.js        — English state data array (STATES_EN). 1723 lines. 51 entries.
├── states-es.js        — Spanish state data array (STATES_ES). 624 lines. 51 entries.
├── netlify.toml        — Build config. Do not touch without explicit instruction.

## Free States (no gate required)
FL, IL, AZ

## Key Architecture Rules — NEVER VIOLATE
1. Scroll chain: every flex ancestor of a scroll container must have min-height:0
2. Never use max-height on tab or list content
3. Never use overflow:hidden on any ancestor of scrollable content
4. Map must call invalidateSize() after any layout change
5. localStorage calls always wrapped in null-safe try/catch
6. Language toggle persists via localStorage key: 'aurigen_lang'
7. Active language loads either STATES_EN or STATES_ES — never both simultaneously
8. Z-index gate fix: .gate-glow must be position:absolute, z-index:0, pointer-events:none !important
9. Never use window.self / window.top / btoa() unsafely in iframe contexts
10. Run node --check on index.html and both .js files before any delivery

## State Data Schema (both EN and ES files must match this exactly)
```
id, name, type, rate, redemption, score, beginnerFriendly,
notBeginnerReason (if beginnerFriendly:false),
scoreWhy, note, risks[], ddExtra[], beginnerTip,
auctionSignup { platform, steps[], depositInfo, directLink },
otc { available, note },
platforms[], counties[]
```

## Business Context
- Owner: Lando (Landon Brewington), Sales Director, real estate education
- Community: Aurigen Collective (free Skool community)
- Lead course: Aurigen Academy
- Target: Tax lien/deed seminar attendees, self-directed investors
- Sales model: Free 7-state access → email gate → Stripe upsell → full 51-state access
- Investor Clarity Call CTA appears per-state for upsell and booking

## Design Identity
Dark cinematic. Near-black backgrounds (#0d0d0d). Gold accent. Off-white text.
Bebas Neue or similar for headlines. DM Sans for body. Motion on load. Glass morphism cards.
Never generic. Never white backgrounds. Never flat.

## NEVER DO
- Reference any specific seminar brand or instructor name in any output
- Deliver any file without running node --check first
- Edit index.html without re-stating the critical connection points first
- Use max-height on tab or list content
- Hardcode colors outside the CSS variable system
